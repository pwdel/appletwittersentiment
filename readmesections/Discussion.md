## Discussion

* Scoring is a form of classification

* Supervised model

* Boundary condition classifying an emotion as, "happy" or "not happy" will always yield a result.

* Whether this result can actually be tied to an actual psychologically defined emotion, or rather, behavior is another question.

* Entire solution found

* Fast ways to solve problems, regular cooking.
* Gourmet Cooking, more creative ways to solve problems.

> What right do we have to say that our model actually describes the desires of our customers?

* Linear Regression Assumptions

* What is the sentiment really positive about?

* Even supposudly golden samples can have irregularities, after all this is all originally human input.  Therefore, additional cleaning using uniques needs to be done.

* Size of data - as we reduced down from golden samples and non-neutral samples

Interesting Learnings within this section:

One interesting part of NLP that I learned through this assignment is that within this specific domain, there are already thousands of pre-trained models to perform tasks on texts such as classification, information extraction, question answering, summarization, translation, text generation, in 100+ human languages. This domain has a wide amount of research work pre-completed, and these pretrained models can be found at [Python Transformers](https://pypi.org/project/transformers/).  Transformers integrates with PyTorch and Tensorflow and has ready-made API's.
