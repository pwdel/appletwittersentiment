## Various Discussion Points that Came to Mind

* Boundary condition classifying an emotion as, "happy" or "not happy" will always yield a result.  In a sense, using logistic regression, or

* Whether this result can actually be tied to an actual psychologically defined emotion, or rather, behavior is another question.

In other words:

> What right do we have to say that our model actually describes the desires of our customers?

* Respect for Golden Samples.  Many machine learning enthusiasts are eager to show a result, build their resume, demonstrate that they can use algorithms and code, in order to get a job.  While the, "shipping code," paradigm works for some functions of data science and machine learning, it does not work for others.  Since AI has such a connection to humans and the real world, results may often require more data, different ways of thinking, willingness to compare models and people who are willing to stand up and move toward the goal of better customer and human interaction.

* Even supposedly golden samples can have irregularities, after all this is all originally human input.  Therefore, additional continuous performance evaluation is needed, if not already in place.

* I created an entire solution.  Entire solution found, though not well put together.  There are fast ways to solve problems, regular cooking.  There's gourmet cooking, more creative ways to solve problems, more finished apps.

* Logistic vs. Linear Regression Assumptions.  Mathematical analogy and underlying assumptions, comparing and contrasting under [Bag of Words Section](/readmesections/BagofWords.md).  Using a Scikit-learn computational abstraction to yield a result is one thing, but there is also a need to understand the mathematical framework behind how the module.

* Size of data - as we reduced down from golden samples and non-neutral samples.  This yields a model which does not produce a solid result, basically insufficient data for fitting a predictive model. Does _Company_ want a person who will scrape bad data in order to show a result which ends up being incorrect or annoying to the customer?  "Just build anything."  Or does _Company_ want someone who can build for this position?
